		<p>I'm a product manager <a href="https://www.leverege.com/">@Leverege</a>, where I focus on IoT technology. I also write about smart cities <a href="https://www.iotforall.com/">@IoTForAll</a>. I'm a recent graduate of Yale University where I studied <a href="http://c2.cs.yale.edu/">Computing and the Arts (CS &amp; Architecture)</a> and <a href ="http://earth.yale.edu/energy-studies"> Energy Technology</a>. I've been a beekeeper, an amateur curler, a straight-edge razor enthusiast, an addiction researcher and an international spicy food challenge record-holder. I pride myself on two things: insatiable curiousity and being able to quote 95% of Step Brothers.

        <br><br>I'll be using this site to track my progress learning data science and link to cool projects I'm working on.</p> </div>
