		<h1>HUZZAH...It's me, Marc Bielas!</h1>
		<p>I'm a Junior at Yale University studying <a href="http://c2.cs.yale.edu/">Computing and the Arts (CS &amp; Architecture)</a> and <a href ="http://earth.yale.edu/energy-studies"> Energy Technology</a>. I've been a beekeeper, an amateur curler, a straight-edge razor enthusiast, an addiction researcher and an international spicy food challenge record-holder. I pride myself of two things: insatiable curiousity and being able to quote 95% of Step Brothers and White Chicks.

        <br><br>I'll be using this site to track my progress learning data science and occasionally throw in some writing.</p> </div>
